Title: How the dinosaurs really went extinct.

Content: The super volcano in your present day Yosemite National Park, mildly erupted. During this eruption, a large chuck of rock was launched into sub-orbit, before crashing down into what would become the Yucatan Peninsula. The water levels were still very low from polar ice, that the rock chuck (Es-189-11-ELE-2322) did not hit water and it on a beach, ejecting dust and water into the atmosphere. 4 years later, combined with the gas cloud and ash from the volcano, the dinosaurs died out.

Title: Orientation

Content: My name is Adam* and I have been on Earth observing and living among you for 40 years. My home planet is located closer to the Galactic Core. We call it Ountana (Oh-tah-nah) and it entered The Union* about 7,000 Earth years ago.

My current job, yes, we still have jobs in The Union*, is to help you get to better know the Earth, its history and the two intelligent species that inhabit it.

This is a complicated process with a lot of moving parts, there is a method to all the madness, however. Me revealing this to you now is a part of the greater plan. Some really critical things are about to be become very public knowledge. Those are going to happen first, and then I start posting here. You’ll understand why when The Event* happens.

The next few months are going to be extremely exciting. New videos, images, and information unlike anything any of you in the history of your species has even dreamed of will begin to emerge into the public realm.

Here are just a few of the items on the list for publications coming late this summer:

THE EARLY SOL SYSTEM
No longer in the shadows: The first true light from your sun
Venus: A planet of pure beauty
Earth Part 1: The first continent
Earth Part 2: The creation of Luna
Mars: The planet of algae
Asteroid Belt: The planet Jupiter tore apart
Jupiter Part 1: The failed second star
Jupiter Part 2: Great Disruptor
Saturn: A unique core
Neptune: The unintentional water world
Uranus: The adopted planet

Here are just a small list of notable events in history that when posted, will be of particular interest.

The cradle of life
The discovery of fire
The Aquatics*: The first intelligent species
The First Homo sapien birth
The Great Flood: Relocating the Venusian's to Earth
First Contact (B.C. Era)
Extinction Level Events (ELE) on Earth and Venus.
The assassination of Caesar
Genghis Khan : Yesugen
A Midsummer Night's Dream
King Charles I : January 30, 1649
Conquest of the Aztec and Inca Empires.
The Last Mammoth
The Inauguration of George Washington
The Moon Landing
I look forward to guiding you along this new journey!

(\\) I can't reveal the real name yet.*

Title: Let me clarify a few things
  
Content: A large chunk of the Internet is being allocated to allow for access to The Link*. It is there that you will see all the videos and images for the entire history of your planet and solar system. As well as access to the knowledge base for your current evolutionary and technical level. We believe humanity now possesses the capacity to understand its place and context in this galaxy.

Part of my teams mandate is to learn Earth’s various cultures and to learn about you. I chose this subreddit to help facilitate the understanding, discussion, and context of what you will be seeing and learning.

This r/TrueHistoryOfEarth is just one of the many official methods that will be used pursuing that mission.

I’ve lived here long enough to know that you need a Subreddit for just about everything. That’s part of my job.

------------------------

UPDATE: May 9, 2021

I can say things and use references to other ideas, simply because you have the capacity to understand the concepts behind the technology and why some technology was used the way it was.

I could sit next to you on a bus, and you'd never know - but that's just me. There are different tiers to The Union\;* though, the "more advanced" a civilization becomes, the more it wants to be left alone. One of you hit the proverbial nail-on-the-head with The Aquatics\*.

The Link* is The Union*'s version of the Internet.

The dinosaur post was posted prematurely. I simply hit publish instead of draft. It was a rough-draft synopsis of one of the extinction events that goes with a video of the event formatted for your Internet. The long string of numbers is just a timestamp -- yes, written in English. I do work with humans also. As far as the glacial thing, you'll just have to watch the video - or use The Timeline* to see for yourself.

Trust me when I say, most of you will be far more interested in The Link* than learning your history -- most new civilizations are.

Why look back when you can go forward?

## Scientific publications
In `Orientation`, u/TheTraveler3649 had said

On the same day, `27 Apr 18:00:01 2021 UTC` a paper titled  ["A diffuse core in Saturn revealed by ring seismology"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13385) is published, covered by a [sciencenews.org article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-planet-core-fuzzy-ring-astronomy-space) on May 6.
> That core isn’t the lump of rock and ice that many scientists had envisioned, the new study finds. Instead, the core is diffuse, pervaded by huge amounts of hydrogen and helium and so spread out that it spans 70,000 kilometers, or about 60 percent of the planet’s diameter, researchers report April 28 at arXiv.org.

In May, another paper titled  ["Fungi on Mars? Evidence of Growth and Behavior From Sequential Images"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351252619_Fungi_on_Mars_Evidence_of_Growth_and_Behavior_From_Sequential_Images) is published.
> Fungi thrive in radiation intense environments. Sequential photos document that fungus-like Martian specimens emerge from the soil and increase in size, including those resembling puffballs (Basidiomycota). After obliteration of spherical specimens by the rover wheels, new sphericals--some with stalks--appeared atop the crests of old tracks.

## Striking similarities to the tv show "Travelers"

Quoting [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/nfdtkr/im_kinda_baffled_by_traveler3649s_roll_out_plan/gylj8fh/) by [u/dnh52](https://old.reddit.com/user/dnh52)

> Ok so I was looking through that guy’s posts, and I saw a pretty big red flag with this one
This is pretty much identical to the plot of Stargate SG-1 season 7 episode 5 which aired July 11, 2003. The main characters in this episode run into a civilization that has developed technology called The Link. It’s a neural interface device they attach to the side of their head, and it allows them to access a database that has information of their entire history. [Here’s the wiki page](https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Link). And here’s a quote from the episode “The link contains the sum total of our knowledge and wisdom. All our history, our culture, our science ... everything”. So either the Stargate series is a form of soft disclosure, or that guy is a really big fan of the show. And frankly, I’m not sure which is worse lol. Because in that episode, The Link was actively messing with people’s heads and altering their memories. And in order to preserve the civilization, The Link was basically hijacking people’s minds and getting them to commit suicide when the population became too large for the level of resources available


[Brad Wright](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942249/) is one of the creators of the show [Stargate SG-1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118480). He is also the creator of the show [Travelers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5651844/).

Comment: Throaway account, because I'm afraid.

I was first "abducted" in 1987. I was 12 years old. I say "abducted", but it's not like that. Actually, you go willingly. It's scary but it's exciting, too, and they are somehow able to make you feel ok about things. It's not until later that you feel bad or like you've been violated. And they don't do a lot of probing, like raping, or anything like that. That's HOllywood nonsense. They look inside of people sometimes, but they have machines that do it. Not really "machines", but it's like a room where things get done and the walls are...It's hard to explain, so just imagine that all the walls are kind of like x-ray machines? That's the easiest way to describe it.

Sometimes there would be others there and they would be looking into them or they'd put them under and cut them open, but not usually. They took tissue samples from all of us, I think, and they never put your under or give you any anasthetic or anything. They just poke you. With like those things they take samples of the ocean floor? LIke that, but really small. They pull out chunks of you. It's usually done on the butt or on the lower back.

Mostly they talked with me. Just questions and they'd show me things, like television shows and things, and they'd ask me questions about them. I think the walls measure our reaction to things, too, same as they take x-rays. I don't know that, but it's the feeling that I got. They NEVER let you ask questions about what they are doing. Even once I got friendly with a few of them, they just do not like it when you ask them questions. They hate it.

You can't understand their language. It just sounds like "hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm". I'm positive that we'll never be able to communicate with them in their language. I should mention that these are the "grays" that you hear about, except they aren't gray. They are sort of beige, and it's clothes anyway. They aren't naked. I don't know if there are others. People say there are, but I've only ever met these. Anyway, you cannot understand them but they can understand you. And they can put thoughts into your head but they can't hear your thoughts. You have to speak to them. They cannot hear very well, or else they are not good understanding English so you have to speak loudly and slowly. I don't know if they understand other langauges, but I'm pretty sure they would. They are interested in all of us, in everything that goes on. They like a lot of things about our culture, too. They like some of our music. Bluegrass is their favorite so far as I've seen. They like it a lot. They LOVE that african instrument that looks like a gourd with 13 strings. LOVE IT. But they cannot stand horns or horn music, so they hate classical music and jazz. I think trumpets sort of sound like their language? It's a feeling that I get, but I've never been able to ask them.

They've taken me up just about every two years, I'd say, since 1987. Just about. Sometimes it's more often, and I didn't go up at all between 1995 and 2000. They usually keep me for what feels like a day, but it turns out to be about four hours. Usually. The longest I stayed with them was three weeks. During that time, they made me make phone calls and "keep up appearances". They aren't really bad...well, i was going to say "people". But they're not really bad people. Or whatever.

The two that I got sort of close with told me to call them Jack and Gina. I don't know if they are male or female or even if they have different sexes. But I know that those aren't their real names. Those are just names that they told me.

They will make contact with Earth on a wide scale in 2021. That's the year when they'll land here, or colonize, or whatever. I'm not exactly sure what their plan is. They don't seem to be evil or dangerous. Their planet is, so they told me anyway, a very long way away. They couldn't explain to me how far, they said, becuase it was too far for me to understand and it was also "close to the side". I have no idea what that meant, but it's always stuck with me. Home is "Too far away for you to understand, but also close to the side." We don't have anything that they want, so they told me. So I don't really know why they come here or why they've taken so many of us up or why they've gotten to be friends with me. They do not have any religion and they don't need oxygen or water or trees or anything, I don't think. They don't eat people. I don't think they want to breed with us or genetically engineer us. I don't know what they want. But they've been coming here for I'd guess at least 10 or 20,000 years. I'm not very good about history and "upper paleolithic" and all that. But they've got video of all sorts of stuff and they showed me video of neanderthals and cro-magnon (which really were JUST like us humans except they all had black skin, way less diversity) and all sorts of other human-like things, Us's, or whatever. And they showed me video of the pyramids being built and this HUGE stone building that I guess is lost somewhere or was destroyed but it was in Europe, I could tell from the video. They have video of them talking with all sorts of people all throughout the history of Earth. They showed me some of them and asked me questions about them but I couldn't understand any of it because I only speak English and even English from 200 or 300 years ago is so different that I could hardly understand it. So I told them that they probably knew more about it all than I did.

I was up three weeks ago. That was the last time. I'm pretty sure that I'll go up again in a couple of years, but I'm not sure after that. The whole "program" or whatever they call it is going to change in July, 2021. I think they said 8th, but it could also have been 18th, I wasn't hearing very well. They weren't trying to intimidate me or even to warn me, so I don't think we have anything to worry about. I hope they don't show the videos they took of me when they first started taking me up, becuase I was so scared and young and they are embarrassing.

Edit...I changed an accidentally racist bit in there that someone pointed out. Changed "They were all black" to "all had black skin, way less diversity".

Edit....No more questions. They are not happy with me. Sorry.
