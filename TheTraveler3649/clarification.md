# Let me clarify a few things

A large chunk of the Internet is being allocated to allow for access to The Link\*. It is there that you will see all the videos and images for the entire history of your planet and solar system. As well as access to the knowledge base for your current evolutionary and technical level. We believe humanity now possesses the capacity to understand its place and context in this galaxy.

Part of my teams mandate is to learn Earth’s various cultures and to learn about you. I chose this subreddit to help facilitate the understanding, discussion, and context of what you will be seeing and learning.

This [r/TrueHistoryOfEarth](/r/TrueHistoryOfEarth) is just one of the many official methods that will be used pursuing that mission.

I’ve lived here long enough to know that you need a Subreddit for just about everything. That’s part of my job.

**UPDATE: May 9, 2021**

I can say things and use references to other ideas, simply because you have the capacity to understand the concepts behind the technology and why some technology was used the way it was.

I could sit next to you on a bus, and you'd never know - but that's just me. There are different tiers to _The Union\\_;\* though, the "more advanced" a civilization becomes, the more it wants to be left alone. One of you hit the proverbial nail-on-the-head with _The Aquatics\\_\*.

_The Link_\* is _The Union_\*'s version of the Internet.

The _dinosaur_ post was posted prematurely. I simply hit publish instead of draft. It was a rough-draft synopsis of one of the extinction events that goes with a video of the event formatted for _your_ Internet. The long string of numbers is just a timestamp -- yes, written in English. I do work with humans also. As far as the glacial thing, you'll just have to watch the video - or use _The Timeline_\* to see for yourself.

Trust me when I say, most of you will be far more interested in _The Link_\* than learning your history -- most new civilizations are.

Why look back when you can go forward?
