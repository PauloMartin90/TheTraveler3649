# Predating scientific publications
In `Orientation`, u/TheTraveler3649 claims

Here are just a few of the items on the list for publications coming late this summer:

THE EARLY SOL SYSTEM
. . .
5.  Mars: The planet of algae
. . .
9.  Saturn: A unique core
```

On the same day, a few hours before u/TheTraveler3649s post, `27 Apr 18:00:01 2021 UTC` a paper titled  ["A diffuse core in Saturn revealed by ring seismology"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13385) is published, and is covered by a [sciencenews.org article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-planet-core-fuzzy-ring-astronomy-space) on `May 6 2021`, an excerpt follows

> That core isn’t the lump of rock and ice that many scientists had envisioned, the new study finds. Instead, the core is diffuse, pervaded by huge amounts of hydrogen and helium and so spread out that it spans 70,000 kilometers, or about 60 percent of the planet’s diameter, researchers report April 28 at arXiv.org.

In `May`, a paper titled  ["Fungi on Mars? Evidence of Growth and Behavior From Sequential Images"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351252619_Fungi_on_Mars_Evidence_of_Growth_and_Behavior_From_Sequential_Images) is published, an excerpt follows

> Fungi thrive in radiation intense environments. Sequential photos document that fungus-like Martian specimens emerge from the soil and increase in size, including those resembling puffballs (Basidiomycota). After obliteration of spherical specimens by the rover wheels, new sphericals--some with stalks--appeared atop the crests of old tracks.
