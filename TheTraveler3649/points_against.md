> My current job, yes, we still have jobs in The Union*, is to help you get to better know the Earth, its history and the two intelligent species that inhabit it.

> The Aquatics*: The first intelligent species

> I could sit next to you on a bus, and you'd never know - but that's just me. There are different tiers to The Union\;* though, the "more advanced" a civilization becomes, the more it wants to be left alone. One of you hit the proverbial nail-on-the-head with The Aquatics\*.

## A volcano launched rocks into sub orbit and caused the mass extinction
In a now deleted post, u/TheTraveler3649 claims
> The super volcano in your present day Yosemite National Park, mildly erupted. During this eruption, a large chuck of rock was launched into sub-orbit, before crashing down into what would become the Yucatan Peninsula. The water levels were still very low from polar ice, that the rock chuck (Es-189-11-ELE-2322) did not hit water and it on a beach, ejecting dust and water into the atmosphere. 4 years later, combined with the gas cloud and ash from the volcano, the dinosaurs died out.
