# Similarities to tv series ["Stargate SG-1"](https://www.google.com/search?q=stargate+sg-1+tv+series) and ["Travelers"](https://www.google.com/search?q=travelers+tv+series)

Reddit user [u/dnh52](https://old.reddit.com/user/dnh52) [says](https://old.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/nfdtkr/im_kinda_baffled_by_traveler3649s_roll_out_plan/gylj8fh/)

> Ok so I was looking through that guy’s posts, and I saw a pretty big red flag with this one. This is pretty much identical to the plot of Stargate SG-1 season 7 episode 5 which aired July 11, 2003. The main characters in this episode run into a civilization that has developed technology called The Link. It’s a neural interface device they attach to the side of their head, and it allows them to access a database that has information of their entire history. [Here’s the wiki page](https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Link). And here’s a quote from the episode “The link contains the sum total of our knowledge and wisdom. All our history, our culture, our science ... everything”. So either the Stargate series is a form of soft disclosure, or that guy is a really big fan of the show. And frankly, I’m not sure which is worse lol. Because in that episode, The Link was actively messing with people’s heads and altering their memories. And in order to preserve the civilization, The Link was basically hijacking people’s minds and getting them to commit suicide when the population became too large for the level of resources available

Several parallels can also be made between Adam*'s claims and [the plot of "Travelers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_(TV_series)#Premise), an excerpt from Wikipedia follows

> In a post-apocalyptic future, thousands of special operatives are tasked with preventing the collapse of society. These operatives, known as "travelers", have their consciousnesses sent back in time and transferred into the "host" body of present-day individuals who would otherwise be moments from death, to minimize unexpected impact on the time line. 

> Trained using social media and public records concerning their hosts, each traveler must maintain the host's pre-existing life as cover for the rest of their lives, while carrying out missions in teams of five.

to which many replied with "I'm Traveler XXXX", including [@netflix](https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1075914899824373760) which replied with

> I'm Traveler 6383. Welcome to the 21st!

The acount u/TheTraveler3649 was created before "Travelers" started, but it can take years from conception to production, so we cannot eliminate this lead.
