The throaway account [u/throawaylien](https://old.reddit.com/user/throawaylien) was created on `Nov 20 2013 04:11:36 UTC`, a few months before u/TheTraveler3649 was created.

u/throawaylien made [a comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1r034d/alien_abductees_of_reddit_or_people_who_have/cdikpd2/) on the same day, talking about their experiences with alien abduction
  
u/throawaylien claimed aliens would make contact with earth on either `July 8 2021` or `July 18 2021`, quoting

> They will make contact with Earth on a wide scale in 2021. That's the year when they'll land here, or colonize, or whatever. I'm not exactly sure what their plan is. They don't seem to be evil or dangerous.
    
> The whole "program" or whatever they call it is going to change in July, 2021. I think they said 8th, but it could also have been 18th, I wasn't hearing very well. They weren't trying to intimidate me or even to warn me, so I don't think we have anything to worry about.
