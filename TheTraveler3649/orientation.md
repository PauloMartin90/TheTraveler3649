# Orientation

My name is _Adam_\* and I have been on Earth observing and living among you for 40 years. My home planet is located closer to the Galactic Core. We call it Ountana (Oh-tah-nah) and it entered _The Union_\* about 7,000 Earth years ago.

My current job, yes, we still have jobs in _The Union_\*, is to help you get to better know the Earth, its history and the two intelligent species that inhabit it.

This is a complicated process with a lot of moving parts, there is a method to all the madness, however. Me revealing this to you now is a part of the greater plan. Some really critical things are about to be become very public knowledge. Those are going to happen first, and then I start posting here. You’ll understand why when _The Event_\* happens.

The next few months are going to be extremely exciting. New videos, images, and information unlike anything any of you in the history of your species has even dreamed of will begin to emerge into the public realm.

​
